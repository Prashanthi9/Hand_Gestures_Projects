Hand Gestures Recognition with Python

This project demonstrates real-time hand gestures recognition using Python, leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system identifies and interprets hand gestures captured through a webcam, providing a versatile interface for various applications such as sign language translation, gesture-based control systems, and interactive interfaces.

Technologies Used
OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library for real-time computer vision tasks including image and video processing.
MediaPipe: A machine learning framework for building applied ML pipelines that process media (e.g., video, audio).
TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework for training and deploying ML models.
NumPy: Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, essential for handling arrays and matrices.

Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time video streams.
Multiple Gestures Support: Recognize a variety of predefined gestures such as thumbs-up, peace sign, and open palm.
Gesture-Based Interactions: Integrate with applications for gesture-based controls and interactions.
User Interface: Display visual feedback and gesture recognition results in real-time.
